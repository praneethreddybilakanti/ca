                    <li><b>Incorporation services: </b>Incorporation is the legal process used to form a corporate
                        entity or company. A corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners, with its own rights
                        and obligations.
                        <p>Incorporation has many advantages for a business and its owners, including protection of the
                            owner's assets, because the company is liable for its own debts. Other advantages include
                            the easy transfer of the business to another party through the sale of shares; the
                            possibility of tax planning for the owner through the use of a lower tax rate than ones for
                            personal income; and access to financing for business activities through, among others, the
                            sale of stock.</p>
